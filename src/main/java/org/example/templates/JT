Introduction to JT
Thanks again for your interest my Spring Framework content!
My name is John Thompson, founder of the Spring Framework Guru website. I thought I'd take a moment to say hello and introduce myself.   I've been in the Information Technology field for about 25 years. I actually started in the industry as a software trainer for a company that made and heavily customized enterprise software. I grew out of that role and transitioned into project management. Since I've always been a roll up your sleeves up type of guy, I gradually became more and more technical.   At first I was heavy Oracle. I actually used to work part time as an Oracle DBA and tuning expert. Along the way I started focusing on Java. Initially it was J2EE, but like many others I ran screaming from the complexity of J2EE and towards the simplicity of the Spring Framework. That journey took me to focusing on Java/Spring development as a full time career. I worked as a Spring Source Consultant directly for Pivotal / EMC for about 18 months at one of their major retail clients. And also spoke at Spring One in 2013.  I started my website because learning Spring is not an easy task. The Spring Framework is a very large framework, designed to solve very complex problems. While the documentation for the Spring Framework is generally very good, I felt it really did not address the needs of someone new to Spring. There's a number of resources available to learn Spring, but they all seem light on pragmatic information. Other resources will show you features and functions, but they don't offer insight of how or when to apply those features. I hope people following my content will be able to learn from my years of experience of using Spring in the field.
In my personal life, I'm an avid triathlete. I'm training for my first Ironman distance race. Hoping a Crossfit Endurance program can help me survive the training and the race, while still having a life!  Please reach out to me anytime. I do try to read and respond to every email!

History of the Spring Framework

To understand the history of the Spring Framework, you need to consider era when Spring was born. It was the late 90s, and the .COM bubble and Y2K where happening.   The computer science 'experts' at Sun released J2EE to address the computing needs of .COM companies. This was the age of the mainframe. You could not build computers big enough to handle the demands of large .COM web sites - not even a mainframe could handle the load.  Since you could not scale up, you had to scale out. Remember, this is pre 'cloud' computing. On paper J2EE looked great. n-tier computing at its finest. Companies like Sun, IBM, and Weblogic touted J2EE as "THE" way to build scalable enterprise applications. (and hey, it was a great way to sell millions of dollars worth of licensing for J2EE application servers!)  Living with J2EE in production did not work out the way it looked like it should on paper. It was brittle, and complex to maintain. Commercial application servers were expensive to buy, and expensive to buy support contracts for. Open source alternatives were in their infancy at the time.  The market was ripe for disruption. Enter the Spring Framework. Spring was the first viable alternative to J2EE. Spring was light, It didn't need a heavy commercial application server to run on. Coding with Spring was simple. Configuring Spring was simple. Due to Spring's ease of use, the framework was adopted quickly for enterprise application development.   When Spring came to the marketplace, Open Source software was just starting to gain traction in the enterprise. How could Open Source, community projects compete against commercial software companies?   We all know how that played out over the last decade. Open Source software is thriving in the enterprise, and Spring is the #1 framework used for Enterprise class Java development.

What is Spring Core?

The "Spring Framework" is a large project. Under the Spring Framework label are actually about 20 different Spring projects. Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Integration, etc. So, it would be easy to get confused about what "Spring Core" is.  The official Spring documentation, contains this image:


"Spring Core" is typically used to refer to the functionality of the Core container. Beans, Core, Context, and SpEL.   While there are about 30 Spring Framework projects, they all depend on this core container. Its this core functionality that has been around since the beginning of the Spring Framework. The core container, which has the Spring Context, manages dependency injection for us via Inversion of Control is used by all other Spring projects.   Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru!


What's new in Spring Framework 5

Spring Framework 5 was released in September of 2017.
This is the most significant release of the Spring Framework since its inception back in 2004.
Checkout this blog post about all the new features inside of Spring Framework 5!

https://www.jetbrains.com/student/  I think this is an awesome deal for students learning to code. If you've been following my material, you've seen that IntelliJ is my IDE of choice. I've used IntelliJ for over a decade and have seen JetBrains consistently improve the product. When I've encountered problems, the JetBrains team was there to support me.
I am a big supporter of IntelliJ, it does make a difference in my day to day productivity.
Cheers,
John Thompson Spring Framework Guru

Who is Rod Johnson?

f you're a Spring Developer, you should be familiar with who Rod Johnson is. Australian born Rod Johnson is to the Spring Framework, what James Gosling is to Java. Some would call them the baby daddy.  Rod is credited with creating the Spring Framework. Rod's book Expert One-on-One J2ee Design and Development led to the creation of the Spring Framework.
Rod went on to form the company SpringSource. Rod sold SpringSource to VMware, who was bought by EMC. EMC later created Pivotal, which is now the company backing the Spring Framework. In 2012, Rod parted ways with VMware and is now on the board of directors of Typesafe - the commercial company backing Scala. I'm curious to see what is to become of that.  I met Rod several years ago at a private party he was hosting. Also in attendance were Crazy Bob Lee, Gregor Hohpe, and John Davies. But that's a story for another day!  Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru

What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a fairly recent project to the Spring Framework family of projects.
Spring Boot is changing the way we develop Spring applications. Before Spring Boot, you'd usually start off with an empty Maven project and a empty maven POM. Then you would go and add in the Spring Dependencies you needed, configure your build options, decide on the container you wanted to run in, setup the your web.xml, etc. It was easily a half day of monkeying around to kicking off a new Spring project.
With Spring Boot, head over to start.spring.io, click off the options you want and download a preconfigured Maven or Gradle project. The dependencies are curated by the Spring Boot team, so you're not stuck finding the magic combination of JARs. Spring Boot itself will automatically create common beans with sensible defaults depending on what classes it finds on your classpath. H2 is on your classpath, okay, create a datasource for an in memory database.
Common configuration tasks which used to take hours and days, now take moments.
You'll see me use Spring Boot in all of my Spring Courses. In my Spring Core Advanced course, I take a Spring Boot project and back out Spring Boot - just so my students can see everything that Spring Boot is managing for them.
Spring Boot is the future of Spring application development.
Spring Boot is much much more than what I've covered here. But there's only so much I can touch on in a short email!

Cupids Undie Run

Once a year, I ask my community to support a charitable cause.
For last several years I've asked for support of Cupid's Undie Run.
In 2018 people in my community helped raise $2,125. Which is just AWESOME.
Cupid's Undie Run is an annual event which raises money to help fight Neruofibromatosis - aka NF.
NF is a condition which causes tumors to grow on the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
It's just an awful condition, which often show's up in early childhood.
I personally know a little girl here in St Petersburg with the condition.
There's also people with my community with NF.
I found this out last year when folks emailed me - thanking me for my fundraising efforts - because they have NF.
For 2019, I'm setting a goal to beat what we raised 2018.
Please click here to donate to Cupid's Charity.
Any amount you can give will help!
Even if it is just $5 - it all ads up!
A sincere thank you!

What is Spring MVC?

So, what is Spring MVC? In a nutshell, Spring MVC is the web front end for the Spring Framework. The request can be a traditional web request for a web page, or a Web Service request (SOAP or RESTFul).
Spring MVC is based on the programming paradigm of Model - View - Controller. The MVC pattern is not Spring, nor Java specific. The MVC pattern has been adapted by a number of languages, and been in use well before Java became the #1 programming language. You'll see the MVC design pattern in just about any common programming language, because of its benefits.
The Model (M) is typically the data in the request or response. The model is just data. The View (V) decides how to render the data of the model. The model doesn't care, nor need to know if the client wants HTML or JSON. The Controller is like a traffic cop. The controller decides how to handle the request. The request comes in, the controller returns the model to the appropriate view.
The MVC design paradigm is very popular because of the separation of concerns. Each component has a job. One specific job. This may remind of you of the Single Responsibility Principle too.
Unfortunately, poor coding practices often violate this separation of concerns. Too often I've seen legacy code calling a database from a JSP page. This is what is known as a code smell. Or a bad programming practice. The view (JSP) is now tightly coupled to the database.
Spring MVC is well designed and follows commonly accepted programming paradigms. Unfortunately, it cannot prevent programmers from creating code smells! Could you access a database from a JSP page while using Spring MVC? Of course you can. The framework cannot stop you from making poor choices.

What is Thymeleaf?

For a long time the Java community has been fascinated with templating engines. I think this may be in part due to the pain caused by dealing with JSPs. But I digress...  Thymeleaf is a relative newcomer when it comes to Java templating engines. What makes Thymeleaf interesting is that it used a natural templating language. Meaning you can view your templates in a browser. Yep, the template language is HTML compliant. Try viewing a JSP page in Chrome and not getting a ganked up result!   This makes Thymeleaf a true pleasure to develop with. You don't need your application deployed to Tomcat. You're not bouncing Tomcat with each refresh. Just make the styling changes to the HTML, save and view in your favorite browser. (Hopefully not IE!)  Because of this ease of use, Thymeleaf is quickly becoming popular in the Java and Spring community.   Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru

So - What is NF?

A few years ago I was unaware the condition known as neurofibromatosis - aka NF.
It was through my involvement with Cupid's Undie run that I first learned about NF.
Last year, one of my students, who has NF, reached out and thanked me for raising money to fight NF.
I asked him to write something about living with NF.
This is what he wrote:
Neurofibromatosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body. I know something about this disease because I was born with it and diagnosed at the age of 2. Over the last 30 years, I have had over 35+ operations to remove tumors from my head all the way down to my feet. I had to learn to deal with learning disabilities, how to deal with the deformation of my foot and to deal with chronic pain from the tumors pressing on the nerves. This disease has at times limited my ability to work full-time and do normal daily activities like taking care of the yard, going to the store, and spending time with family and friends in the outdoors. I hope that one they will find a cure for all three types of Neurofibromatosis.
He has asked to remain anonymous, since he would like the companies he is currently applying to not to know about his disease.
Learning to code take a lot of hard work.
Can you imagine learning to code with NF?
Your generous contributions are making a difference!
So far in 2019, we have raised $1,625!
Thank you so much!!
That puts me to 65% of my goal.
My fundraising contest for the 2019 Cupids Undie Run continues:

Who is Josh Long?

If you're getting into the Spring Framework, Josh Long is a name you should be familiar with. Josh is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh's whole job is to support you, as a Spring Developer. Josh is a committer on the Spring Framework, and you'll often see Josh speaking at conferences, and webinars. Josh is one of my favorite speakers to see. I always pick up some cool stuff from him!  Josh is very active on twitter, he's worth following if you use Twitter. By following Josh you can stay up on the latest news in Spring.  I've met Josh a few times at several SpringOne conferences. He's a great guy, with a ton of energy. (actually hard to keep with with sometimes!)  One thing for sure about the Spring and Java communities, is they are always evolving. Josh is a resources you should be familiar with. He's a great resource to follow to stay up on current trends.   Josh is also the co-author on the book Spring Recipes. I own a copy of this book. It's a nice pragmatic guide to leveraging Spring features / projects for common enterprise applications. If you're a bookworm, this is valuable addition to your library.   Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru

Why Spring Data JPA is so cool!

Spring Data JPA is one of my favorite Spring Projects. For you as the Spring Developer, it is a true time saver.   One of the tasks as a developer you are often faced with is putting stuff in a database, and getting stuff from a relational database. In the Java world, we use JDBC to communicate with the database. The Java Persistence API, or JPA is the standard way of mapping Java objects to relational database tables (aka ORM).  Working with JPA over JDBC is a huge timesaver alone. Once you have JPA configured, you'll be writing significantly less code using JPA than you would with JDBC.  What I love about Spring Data JPA, is this can reduce the code you need to write even further. Through the use of a Spring Data JPA Repository, if you had a User domain object with the property of firstName, you could define a method called findByFirstName(String firstName) and Spring Data JPA will handle all the implementation details for you. No need to write SQL, or any query. No need to deal with an entity manager or database connection. All handled for you.  I'm a big fan of Spring Data JPA. I personally use it whenever I can. If you're using JPA to persist data, Spring Data JPA is a Spring project that needs to be on your short list!  Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru

What is JDBC Template?

In my last email I wrote about why Spring Data JPA is so cool to use. In it I mentioned using JDBC.   If you've used just JDBC to get things in and out of a database, you know it can be rather verbose. JDBC can also be very finicky to deal with.   While JPA is clearly the preferred way of interacting with a database, there are times where you need more fine grained access. Maybe you're just extracting data from a legacy database for some type of data conversion or reporting need. It may not be worth going through the work of setting up JPA.  This is where Spring's JDBC Template steps in. If you're working within a Spring environment, JDBC Template is the preferred method of access the database directly. You can read more about JDBC Template here. I highly recommend you use JDBC Template over rolling your own JDBC connection. Using JDBC Template will help you from preventing common errors.

I have a lot more great content around the Spring Framework and Java development coming your way!   Cheers,  John Thompson Become a Spring Framework Guru

What's a couple decimals between friends?

About 8 years ago, I was working at a startup. It was like the wild west. There was no structure or procedures. Way too often, people were coding and testing - right in production.
Clearly, not good. Especially, considering we were moving money around.
We had a task to update customer balances with ACH transfers using a file received from our bank. The task was not too complicated. A simple flat file with account and transfer amount.
Really nothing all that sexy. No JSON, no XML. Just a simple text file. Rather boring.
It's rather common for financial files to use a implied decimal. Thus, $10 dollars in the file would be 1000. The decimal is implied 1000, is really 10.00.
My buddy worked on the code to parse the file and update accounts. We didn't know the file had a implied decimal.
The fatal mistake he made? He actually checked the code into source control.In this crazy startup environment, he did the right thing and actually checked code into source control.
That evening, another developer saw the code in source control, and thought he'd do us a favor and deploy the code to production. (completely untested code)
The code worked flawlessly. Our banking partner dropped a file, the code picked up the file, and updated accounts. With amounts two decimals off.
Luckily, we didn't have a lot of customers at the time, and only a thousand accounts got updated. 
About two days later we had the mess cleaned up. Data fixed, customers apologized to, and we survived several floggings from management.
Today we laugh about the incident. After all, what's a couple decimals between friends? Right?
Moral of the story? There's so much we were doing wrong... I'm not sure where to start!
Processes and procedures do add overhead, and take time to manage. But they exist for a reason. That reason is to prevent mistakes like this. In this situation, we were taking shortcuts, and got burned because of it.

But my 2000 line method unit tested just fine!

No joke, I had a developer argue with me that their 2,000 line method unit tested just fine. One entry point, followed by 2,000 lines of code.
Are you skeptical? Yeah, so was I.
If we used a code coverage tool, what do you think it would reflect? Would the conditions of every if statement be covered? Every switch statement covered? Every exception covered?
I saw the code, and the tests. I assure you, there was plenty of code not getting tested.
Writing software is a craft. If you learn how to use a saw to cut wood, are you a master carpenter?
No. It takes time to develop skills to turn raw wood into beautiful cabinets.
It also takes time to learn how to write quality code. In this case, the developer I was working with did not know a 2,000 method was a poor programming practice. This wasn't a Object Oriented programming style that elegantly applied the SOLID principles. It was a long drawn out procedural coding style. While Java is a Object Oriented language, you can still write procedural code in Java. (I've seen it way too many times!!!)
How long should your methods be?
A great rule I learned from one of Uncle Bob Martin's books, Clean Code, is your methods should be no longer than about one screen of code. Just one. If you need to scroll down, chances are you're doing something wrong.
This is a very simple rule you can start applying tomorrow. If the section of code you are working on is getting longer than a about screenful, chances are:
•	You're slipped into a procedural style of coding
•	Your code is doing too many things - violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
•	Your code is no longer 'unity', not easy to unit test
•	Your code quality suffers because of poor test coverage, because unit tests are too complex to write properly
•	Your code is brittle to changes. Modifications are no longer encapsulated - changing one thing, breaks another!
This is just one tip from Uncle Bob's book. Clean Code really is one of my favorite programming books. I've read it several times. Reading it will help you develop your own software craftsmanship. I consider the book one of those must have's for any developer's bookshelf.

How do you secure Spring Applications?

When it comes to securing access to Spring based applications, Spring Security is the tool you want to be using. Spring Security is a standalone project under the Spring family of projects and it is actively maintained by Pivotal.   Spring Security is designed for securing access to Java based applications. The most common use case is with web based Java applications, but it actually can be used with any Java application, whether it is a GUI client or some type of exposed API.  Spring Security looks at two areas when allowing access to an application. One is authentication, the other is authorization. The first is authentication, which asks the question who am I? This establishes identity. This could be a user id password from a database or LDAP server. Or in other cases from a 3rd party via OpenID. The second area is authorization. Is the user allowed to take the requested action. This asks the question are they allowed to do this?  Spring Security is a mature product and has been around sometime. It is common to see used for building enterprise applications in Spring. Spring Security can easily be used with LDAP servers or Microsoft Active Directory. Having this integration with centralized identity servers is important to companies because of compliance issues. When an associate leaves the company, the company need to have established procedures to terminate the associate's access to its systems. And being able to integrate with LDAP / Active Directory is the perfect tool for corporate compliance.  Cheers,  John Thompson Spring Framework Guru  PS - If you want to learn more about Spring Security, I do have a course under construction. You can learn more about it here.
https://spring.io/projects/spring-security
https://springframework.guru/spring-courses/spring-security-course/

Are you Open or Closed?

So are you Open or Closed?  Actually, I'm talking about the Open Closed Principle of Object Oriented design. This states your classes should be open for extension, but closed to change. It's a design principle which will help you write better code. If you're not familiar with the Open Closed Principle, head over to my blog and learn more!

Why I use IntelliJ

In all my videos, you will see me using the IntelliJ IDE. This is my preferred IDE for use.
But if you follow videos produced by Pivotal, you will typically see them using STS - Spring Tool Suite. This is an extension of the popular Eclipse IDE. So if you're new to Spring development, you may be confused why I chose to use IntelliJ IDEA over STS.
Java developers can be rather passionate about their IDE of choice. I'm no exception. I feel IntelliJ is a better option for Java development. I even produced a short video about it!
I feel so strongly about IntelliJ, my company is actually a partner with IntelliJ. Through this partnership, I'm able to offer students in my premium courses an extended trial license to IntelliJ IDEA.

Getting Social with Spring Social

Wondering what Spring Social is? Well, it is not a high school dance in the Springtime!
Spring Social is a Spring project designed to help you interact with various Social Networks using the Spring Framework.
Have you seen websites that allow you to sign in using Facebook or Twitter? This is exactly what Spring Social can do for you. When you're building a web application using Spring and Spring MVC, you can add Spring Security / Spring Social to allow users to authenticate in your application using popular social networks.
But Spring Social is not limited to just authentication. Each of the social networks have APIs you can use. Maybe you want to get a user's birthday from their Facebook profile, or maybe send a Tweet for them. Yep, there's an API for that!

Batching things up with Spring Batch

Much of today's literature around software development is around real time processing. For example, handling a web request, this is real time processing. (Some may argue, near time - but I digress)
But in the enterprise, batch processing is still alive and well. Sometimes it's just how legacy systems work. Other times, batch processing can be the right tool for the job. I personally favor realtime processing over batch whenever possible. However, sometimes things are out of your control. Maybe you're depending on a 3rd party vendor to deliver a daily extract file? Or you need to deliver a daily summary report to someone else in the enterprise? In cases like these, a batch process works out to be the right tool for the job.
Batch processing in the enterprise is not going anywhere anytime soon. When you do need to perform batch processing, Spring Batch is the natural tool of choice. This is a mature set of Spring tools to handle your batch processing needs.

John Thompson Spring Framework Guru

Just who is Chris Schaefer?

So, just who is Chris Schaefer? Yesterday, I told you a little bit about Spring Batch. Chris is a Pivotal employee and a committer on the Spring Batch project. Chris also leads the Sarasota JUG. (I used to speak there occasionally years ago)
Chris and I also worked together supporting Spring development at Kohls. Pivotal had both of us Florida boys flying up to Milwaukee, WI several times a month for about 18 months. Milwaukee is a great town - in the summer time. Winters in Milwaukee are COLD. Chris and I spent more than one evening complaining about the snow and ice in Milwaukee!
Chris is also a co-author of Pro Spring. This is the 4th edition of a cornerstone book covering the Spring Framework (updated for Spring 4). This is one of those books worthy of adding to your library.

Using pagination in Hibernate

When dealing with large sets of data, it's a common use case to display the data in scrollable chunks to the user.
If you're dealing with a relational database and using Spring, it's likely under the covers you'll be using Hibernate for your ORM. Spring often abstracts Hibernate, so you're not exposed to what's happening under the covers. But I feel it's important to understand what is actually happening. Thus, I wrote a blog post on pagination in Hibernate. If you find the the post helpful, please leave me a comment!

Which flavor of Linux should you be using with Java

Linux, like craft beer comes in many different flavors. And like craft beer, people have some very passionate opinions about which Linux distribution is "best".   Is SUSE really better than Red Hat? Is Red Hat a better option than Ubuntu? CentOS? Oracle Linux? Amazon Linux? Debian? OpenSUSE?   Oh my, the choices are endless. I've recorded a short video on Youtube to offer my opinion on this matter.

How to process JSON data in Java

A lot of times when you're working with Spring, marshalling to and from JSON is often obfuscated by the framework. Meaning, under the covers Spring is taking a JSON string and converting it to a Java object, or taking a Java object and creating a JSON string for it.   But let's take a closer look under the covers at what Spring is doing. While there are options, typically Spring will be using Jackson to marshal / unmarshal JSON data. I wrote a blog post to get you introduced to Jackson.   As a Java developer, you will be working with JSON to communicate with other systems. When I need to work directly with JSON, like many others, Jackson is the tool set I turn to.  Cheers,  John Thompson Spring Framework Guru

Using Logback with Spring Boot

When you're developing enterprise class applications, logging is an important aspect. There's a crazy number of options available for logging with Java. And Java developers can have very passionate opinions about which logging framework is the best to use.  While Spring and Spring Boot do not mandate a specific logging framework, Spring Boot does by default use Logback, which is a solid option for your logging needs.   I've written a blog post about configuring Logback with Spring Boot. You can check it out here.   Cheers,  John Thompson Spring Framework Guru

Can you call a Java function from a Thymeleaf Template?

Tabs vs Spaces

Tabs vs Spaces - an ongoing debate in the developer community.
Enjoy this clip from HBO's Silicon Valley:
Silicon Valley is one of my favorite shows. I've done a lot of work out in the valley, and this show is a little too close to reality!
In case you're wondering. Spaces. Definitely spaces.
And I also use vim over emacs.

Creating JSON with Jackson

As you may know, Jackson is the default JSON library used by Spring Boot.
Under the covers, its Jackson that is converting JSON to Java POJOs, or Java POJOs to JSON.
Jackson gives you a tremendous amount of control over the aspects of marsalling and unmarshalling JSON.
Checkout my detailed blog post about common annotations you can use to control the behavior of Jackson.

Java 8 forEach Loops
Java 8 brought us new functionality with the Java forEach loop.
This is a very important and useful feature in Java 8.

Jackson Mix-In Annotations
A few days ago I told you about using Jackson to work with JSON.
As you saw, Jackson right out of the box gives you some great functionality.
And using Java annotations, you get a lot of control over how JSON is marshalled and unmarshalled to / from Java POJOs.
But, what if you don't have access to the Java source code of the POJOs you're working with.
No worries! Checkout the Jackson Mix-In annotation in my blog post here!

Showing SQL Used by Hibernate
Hibernate is a very common ORM used with Spring Framework applications. I frequently use Hibernate and Spring Data JPA when building Spring Applications.
Hibernate does a great job of abstracting the database from our Java code.
Its awesome you can write a lot of functionality against a database without writing any SQL code.
BUT - there are times you wish to see what Hiberate is doing.
There are several tools we can use with Hibernate and Spring to log the SQL geneated to the console.
Checkout this blog post about how you can enable the output of the SQL generated by Hibernate in your application.

Spring Component Scan

The Spring Framework will do something called a component scan. This is when Spring scans a package structure looking for classes annoated as Spring components.

If you're used to using Spring Boot, you get his for free. Spring Boot will automatically scan the package and below of the main class of the Spring Boot application.

Of course, you do not want to scan every class on the classpath. A large Java project can have 10's of thousands of classes, so this would be very costly.

The Spring Framework does offer you a lot of control over how it will conduct scanning for Spring components.

Thus, you can make your component scans very targeted, limiting the impact on the stratup time of your application.

If you'd like to learn more about the capabilities of Spring's component scans, checkout this blog post.

@RequestMapping with Spring

Its a faily common task to deal with web clients when working with the Spring Framework. You might be just serving up simple HTML pages using Thymeleaf, or maybe writing Restful webservices with Spring MVC.
In either case, one tool you can turn to is the @RequestMapping annoation. Through this annoation, you can desigate which controller method to use for responding to specfic requests.
This annoation gives you a great deal of control in mapping requests.

What's Spring Cloud Contract?

 Recently, I interviewed Marcin Grzejszczak, the project lead on the Spring Cloud Contract project.
Spring Cloud Contract is a testing framework which supports consumer driven contracts.
What are consumer driven contracts and why do you care? Checkout the interview!
If you follow my blog, you already know I'm a fan of Spring Cloud Contract.
Spring Cloud Contract is a tool I've been using a lot at my day job. We've been busy implementing contracts for all of our public facing APIs. And starting to use it on our internal APIs too.
In the interview we cover what consumer driven contracts are, the history of Spring Cloud Contact, our experiences using it, and also talk about Marcin's new course on Spring Cloud Contract.
I hope you enjoy the chat I had with Marcin!

Teach Yourself Programming in 10 years

I recently had a student ask my how long it took before I considered myself a senior developer.
I sent them a link to this famous post by Peter Norvig about teaching yourself programming in 10 years.
Who? Norvig is the director of research at Google and has a Ph.D. in computer science from Berkly. In short, very smart guy.
10 years? Really?
What about the books that say I can learn Java in 21 days?
Yes, 10 years.
Sorry, there are no short cuts.
Coding is a skill which develops over time.
Like working with wood.
Think about carpenters.
I enjoy working with wood. I can cut wood, and build numerous things out of wood.
Need a wall - no problem!
Need kitchen cabinets? You might want to call someone else!
I have huge respect for carpenters. They can create amazing things from wood. With skills that took many years to develop.
The same analogy can be used with software developers.
In my early days, I dabbled with PHP and Visual Basic.
I assure you the code I wrote was AWFUL!
But I've grown and learned a lot since then. As all developers do.
Anyhoo - either way, if you're a new developer, or have a programming career well under way. Teach Yourself Programming in 10 years is a great read.
Enjoy,
John Thompson

Spring Boot Microservices Course now Available!

Hola Gurus!
You guys spoke, and I listened!
Back in January I sent out a survey asking you what courses you would like to see in 2019.
I thought Spring Security was going to win.
But I was wrong! Spring Boot Microservices came in at a solid #1.
Thus, all year long I've been working on a Spring Boot Microservices course!

Today through the end of July, you can get my latest course Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud Beginner to Guru for just $9.99.
If you have taken my Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru course, this is an ideal next course.
My Spring Boot Microservices course is targeted for intermediate students. You should be comfortable with Spring, Docker, and MySQL.
I know a lot of organizations are starting to adopt using microservices.
One very fun exercise you will experience in the course is taking a traditional monolithic application and then breaking it into microservices.
Through this, you get to see some of the challenges you will encounter when when moving to a microservice based architecture.
Please note: this is a MVP Release. There are almost 18 hours of content available right now.
I'm just completing some content about using Sagas with Spring Boot Microservices and Spring State Machine. And then I will be getting into the Spring Cloud content, starting with Spring Cloud Config.
And yes, once I wrap up this course - I'm starting work on a Spring Security course - which was clearly #2 on my survey.
Join Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud today for just $9.99!
As part of this course launch, you can get any of my other courses for just $9.99 too! Just use the code JULY_LAUNCH at checkout!
Don't forget - this offer will end on July 31st!

What is the term MVP in a startup context?

MVP is a commonly used term.
If you're into sports, you may think of MVP as an acronym for Most Value Player.
Not in a startup context.
For startups, MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product.
MVP is a concept that helps you focus on what you need to go to market.
What are the minimum things you need for your customers?
Think about Uber for example.
I've been a fan of Uber for a long time.
Years ago, Uber was pretty simple. There was no surge pricing. No ride sharing.
Many features Uber has today, where missing a couple years ago.
Uber got their app out the door, got customers using it, then improved it.
Which is what I've done with my Spring Boot Microservices course.
Yesterday, I announced the MVP release of Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud Beginner to Guru.
The response has been amazing!
This has been my best course launch EVER.
Over 650 Gurus joined the course!
For those who joined the course, THANK YOU!
For those who have not - what are you waiting for!?!? The $9.99 price will expire tomorrow!
With almost 18 hrs of content, this is the most comprehensive course you will find on Spring Boot Microservices.
And I'm just starting to produce the Spring Cloud content! Much more to come!
You can get this course, or any of my other courses for just $9.99 too!
Just use the code JULY_LAUNCH at checkout!
Don't forget - this offer will end on July 31st!

The Happiness Formula

 Many of you may know Scott Adams as the creator of the Dilbert comic strips (which are always great). Scott also has some really interesting books and a podcast.
I listened to his latest episode during my morning walk today.
Scott goes through a number of interesting tips, like creating systems - which is something I'm personally trying to get better at.
One of Scott's other tips was to learn something new everyday.
I enjoy learning every day.
Sometimes, its in the course of my job as a software engineer.
Sometimes, its just out of personal interest.
Sometimes, I learn while developing my courses.
I learned a ton in preparing for my latest course on Spring Boot Microservices.
Which seems to show, since your ratings have made this the Highest Rated Spring Boot course on Udemy!
I'll be learning more this weekend as I develop the Spring Cloud content for this course!

If you wish to learn something new every day, my Back to School course continues through this Saturday!
Just use the coupon code AUG_2019 to get any of my courses for just $9.99.

 Hola Gurus,
I've received a few questions about which course to take first - Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru or Spring Boot Microservices B2G.
Definitely take the Spring Framework 5 course first. This course is an introductory course to the Spring Framework. It is more broad in scope on all things Spring.
The Spring Boot Microservices course assumes you already know have skills with the Spring Framework. This is a more advanced course. Its the ideal follow-on course after the Spring Framework 5 course. And it is focused specifically on building mircorservices with Spring Boot.
This week I've been writing code for the next section of the Spring Boot Microservices course.
Sagas with Spring State Machine, ActiveMQ Artemis, Project Lombok, MapStruct, WireMock - a lot of cool stuff coming together! I'm having a lot of fun coding this section of the course. This is the type of Spring code I do on a day to day basis with the payments startup I work for.
Through Saturday, get any of my Udemy courses for just $10.99!
